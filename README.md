Use the ChatGPT Web models available on your account, including Pro, from Codex’s native model picker—with ChatGPT Web’s separate usage limits, without spending your Work or Codex quota. Keep the same interface, tasks, images, and streaming.

Full harness mode connects ChatGPT to the current task’s files, terminal, tools, and approvals through MCP. Conversations stay tied to your Codex task, so you can keep working as the context grows.

<div id="get-started"><a id="quick-start"></a></div>

## Get started

**Available models:** Free/Go → **Luna / Think**. Accounts with reasoning controls → **Instant–High**, plus **Extra High** and **Pro** when available. The launcher detects what your account can use.

1. **Install the launcher** using the download for your system above.
2. **Sign in to ChatGPT** in the embedded browser and run the browser smoke test.
3. **Install models**, restart Codex once, and choose a **ChatGPT Web — …** model.
4. **For coding with tools**, open **MCP** in the launcher and complete the Full harness setup below.

The app includes its browser and runtime. No separate Chrome, Node, or Bun installation is needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Terminal install, updates & repair</strong></summary>

Quit the launcher before updating. These installers select the platform and architecture, verify the published checksums, and preserve your ChatGPT profile and launcher settings.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.sh | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.ps1 | iex
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Models, modes & MCP setup</strong></summary>

<a id="modes"></a>

Automatic modes offer Luna/Think when the account has no reasoning selector; otherwise Instant–High, with Extra High and Pro available independently when exposed by the account.

| Mode | Sending messages | Local Codex tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser-only** | Automatic | No |
| **Full harness (With Automation)** | Automatic | Yes, through MCP |
| **Zero Risk** | Paste and send manually | Yes, through a separate MCP connector |

Zero Risk does not read or operate the ChatGPT page. Choose the model and `Codex Zero Risk` connector yourself, paste and send the prepared prompt, then confirm **Sent** in the launcher. Automatic model entries each select a fixed ChatGPT mode; Codex’s Effort and Speed rows do not override it.

<a id="full-harness"></a>

### Full harness

Full mode connects ChatGPT's tool calls back to the current Codex task through the official
[OpenAI tunnel-client](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client). The tunnel is outbound: it does
not expose a public IP, open an inbound port, or require router forwarding.

The launcher's **MCP** page guides the complete setup. For the exact clicks, see the
[video walkthroughs](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

> **Limits**
>
> See [Limits](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/discussions/309) for the current
> ChatGPT message allowances for **GPT-5.6 Sol Pro** and **GPT-6 Astra**. Context limits depend on
> the account type and selected effort. Plus Medium/High uses a measured 90,000-token window, or
> up to 270,000 tokens with experimental **3× context** enabled, with native Codex compaction
> supported throughout.

1. Finish the required setup, open **MCP**, create the Tunnel and regular API key, then press
   **Connect harness**.
2. Enable ChatGPT **Developer Mode** and create a new Tunnel connector named exactly
   **Codex Native2**, with **Authentication: None** and **Allow all actions**.
3. Run **Verify runtime** to confirm that **Codex Native2** is attached and available.

Write/modify actions also require the ChatGPT workspace and its administrator policy to permit
them. See
[developer mode and MCP apps](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).
Unexpected approval prompts fail closed unless `--auto-approve-tool-calls` is explicitly enabled;
that option clicks **Allow once**, never a permanent grant.

<details>
<summary><strong>Browser-only local exec (HITL)</strong></summary>

<a id="hitl"></a>

When the MCP tunnel isn't an option (e.g. it's blocked on your network), `--hitl` lets a
browser-only session run local shell commands directly from the terminal instead, gated by your
explicit approval on every single command:

```bash
codex-chatgpt-web setup --browser-only --acknowledge-unofficial
codex-chatgpt-web serve --hitl
```

`--hitl` requires `--browser-only` (full mode already has real tool calls through MCP) and only
activates in the foreground with an attached TTY — it fails closed (no exec) under any other
condition, such as running as a background service.

Commands are confined to a **workspace root**: the directory you run `serve` from, or the one given
with `--workspace` (Codex does not tell the daemon which project it has open, so point this at the
same project):

```bash
codex-chatgpt-web serve --hitl --workspace D:\path\to\your\project
```

If you accept the risk, `--hitl-auto-approve` skips the per-command prompt entirely: every command
the model requests runs immediately (still confined to the workspace root and echoed to the
terminal), including destructive ones.

On Windows the launcher can do this for you: **Settings → Local exec (HITL)** lets you pick the
workspace folder and opens a terminal window running the server. Close that window to stop it, and
use **Leave HITL mode** to hand the port back to the launcher's background runtime.

The model is told this root and asked for relative `cwd` values. A request whose `cwd` resolves
outside it is blocked without prompting, logged as `[hitl] blocked EXEC_REQUEST ...`, and the model
is told why so it can retry with a relative path.

Once active, the model can ask to run a command by emitting an `[EXEC_REQUEST]` block; the
terminal shows an **AI EXECUTION PROPOSAL** and waits for you to press Enter/`y` to run it, `n`/Esc
to reject, or `c` to edit the command first. Nothing executes without that per-command approval.

There is no MCP subagent tool available over this transport, so the model is instead instructed to
delegate independent sub-tasks by running `codex exec` non-interactively as an approved shell
command (e.g. a scoped code review of one file), reading the result back with a second
`[EXEC_REQUEST]`.

**Current limitations:**

- **Write-capable, not sandboxed by content.** The exec channel runs whatever command you approve
  — including destructive ones (`rm`, `git commit`, `sed -i`, …) — with real effects on your
  filesystem. The only built-in restrictions are that commands are confined to the configured
  workspace directory, and every single command needs your explicit approval; there is no
  automatic read-only enforcement or command blocklist.
- **10-minute timeout, 10KB output cap per command.** Long-running or chatty commands are cut off
  and truncated; scope delegated sub-tasks narrowly (one file or question, not a full audit).
- **Single-line commands only.** The `command:` field is parsed as one line, so a delegated task
  prompt must be single-quoted and free of embedded newlines or single quotes.
- **Unverified signal propagation.** The timeout sends SIGTERM to the command's shell process; whether
  that reliably reaches everything a nested `codex exec` spawns hasn't been independently confirmed.

<summary><strong>Diagnostics & subagents</strong></summary>

<a id="operations"></a>

Use **Activity** for safe local diagnostics and **Settings → Run doctor** for end-to-end health.
Settings can also cancel a retained browser turn or remove the Codex integration before uninstall.
Set `CODEX_CHATGPT_WEB_BROWSER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` only when every browser checkpoint needs a screenshot.

New installs use **Compatibility V1** for cross-backend subagents. **Native** preserves Codex's own
feature settings and enables plaintext Web-to-Web V2 delegation. Restart Codex and start a new task
after changing the protocol:

```bash
codex-chatgpt-web subagents status
codex-chatgpt-web subagents compatibility-v1
codex-chatgpt-web subagents native
```

<summary><strong>Requirements & security</strong></summary>

<a id="limitations-and-security"></a>

- This is unofficial browser automation, not an OpenAI API. ChatGPT UI changes can break selectors;
  drift fails explicitly instead of silently switching model or transport.
- Browser state is a sensitive login artifact, and the loopback listener is reachable by processes
  running as the same local user. Never share the launcher profile; use a trusted workstation.
- Release packages currently target macOS 13+ (arm64/x64), Windows x64, and Linux x64. Runtime,
  tests, and packaging are gated on all three in CI; account-bound browser and MCP flows use the
  separate [release validation](docs/release-validation.md).
- Builds are not yet platform-signed, so Gatekeeper or SmartScreen may warn. The installers verify
  the published SHA-256 manifest before installation.

Read the complete [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and
[security model](docs/security-model.md) before enabling full mode. Report vulnerabilities through
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Temporary Chat is a [ChatGPT privacy mode](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq); prompts are still processed by OpenAI.

Validation coverage: [release validation](docs/release-validation.md).

This is independent software and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI. Use it only with
your own account and in accordance with applicable [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/)
and workspace policies; it does not bypass authentication or access controls.

<details>
<summary><strong>Run from source & develop</strong></summary>

<a id="development"></a>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web.git && \
cd codex-chatgpt-web && \
bun run app
```

This source path requires Bun 1.4.0. The command installs locked dependencies and opens the app.

```bash
bun run app
bun run dev:launcher
bun run src/cli.ts dev status
bun run dev:chat compaction-lab "Reply with exactly: DEV READY"
bun run verify
bun run smoke:subagents
bun run app:package
```

`dev:launcher` uses a separate profile and account under `~/.codex-chatgpt-web-dev`. `dev:chat` exercises the real browser and compaction paths with explicit simulated tool results, without changing your normal Codex route. See the [DEV chat harness](docs/dev-chat.md) for setup and commands.
